        <h2>180 Emblems</h2>
        <p>
            In <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i>, there are 180 Emblems throughout the game available for a player to collect. The 180 emblems can be collected by clearing
            levels, completing missions, collecting chaos emeralds, and through unlocked bonus/secret stages. For players looking to 100% complete the game
            collecting the 180 emblems is essential. Collecting 180 emblems is considered a great achievement for players whether they are speedrunning or 
            not. The "<b>180 Emblems</b>" category in <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i> speedrunning is considered a subcategory where the goal is not to necessarily beat the 
            game but rather to complete the challenge of obtaining 180 Emblems. Many players play this category of speedrunning alongside "<b>Any%</b>" runs 
            where any percent of the game can be completed. The community competing in this category has looked to optimize routes and plans to collect the 
            180 Emblems as fast as possible creating skips and guides to reduce time.
