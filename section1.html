        <h3>Hero Story</h3>
        <p>
            The "Hero Story" in <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i> focuses on Sonic the Hedgehog (main protagonist) and his allies Tails and Knuckles as they work together
            to stop Dr. Eggman and his evil plans to conquer the world. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/06/22/sonic-adventure-2" target="_blank">[2]</a> In the speedrunning community, the "Hero Story" is one of the most popular categories
            for <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i>. The community for <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i> speedrunning has created a competitive scene for getting the fastest times beating
            the game. Many players would upload their times to websites such as <a href="https://www.speedrun.com" target="_blank">Speedrun.com</a>. Players would also directly compete against 
            each other during events such as <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com" target="_blank">Games Done Quick (GDQ)</a> where live races would take place. Players would devise skips such
            as "Crazy Gadget Skip Skip" and "Final Rush Skip" to get faster times. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vfFbui-9du8&themeRefresh=1" target="_blank">[3]</a> These skips would often "break" the game by bypassing certain sections of
            the game which was intended to be played normally. The story would end in an epic battle against Dr. Eggman and his final weapon, with Sonic and
            his team eventually saving the day.
        </p>
        <h3>Dark Story</h3>
        <p>
            The "<i>Dark Story</i>" in <i>Sonic Adventure 2</i> focuses on the antagonists of the game being Dr. Eggman, Shadow the Hedgehog, and Rouge the Bat. This is
            a less popular speedrunning category as players have found the category to have a tough barrier of entry with many crucial skips at the beginning
            being tough to do. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/speedrun/comments/xyaz1c/the_skip_that_killed_dark_story_speedruns_in/?rdt=61028" target="_blank">[4]</a> While players do play this category, many players prefer "<i>Hero Story</i>" as the category to play and compete in.
